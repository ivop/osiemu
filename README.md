## Command line options

## Build instructions

### Linux

```
git clone https://github.com/ivop/osiemu
cd osiemu
make release
```

```make``` without any arguments will build a debug version (no optimizations, and level 3 debug info).

### Windows

Use Cygwin64. MingW64 doesn't work because it is missing mmap and getline.

## Future additions?

* Serial: Serial I/O without keyboard and display (named sockets)
* Sound: 1-bit ACIA RTS DAC (which model?)
* Sound: SN76489AN and/or AY-3-8910 daughterboard
* Harddisk: Model 590/592/594/596/598 Winchester, Shugart, and Okidata, CD-74 74MB, CD-36 36MB, CD-28 28MB, CD-23 23MB, or CD-7 7MB hard drives.
