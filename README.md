## Configuration files

Configuration files contain command line options, one per line.
The leading -- is optional.
If an option requires an argument, the option and the argument can be
separated by either a space or a '='.
Everything after the first space or '=' until the end of the line is
considered the argument. There's no need (and it's not supported) to put
arguments between single or double quotes. Escaping of characters isn't
needed either.

Example:

```
zoom 2
scanlines
video-mode=32x32
--cpu-speed half
kernel=long path with spaces/synmon.rom
```

More examples are in the _config_ directory.  

## Build instructions

### Linux

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ivop/osiemu
cd osiemu
make release
```

```make``` without any arguments will build a debug version (no optimizations, and level 3 debug info).  
You can override the sdl2-config utility used by setting the SDL2CONFIG variable on the command line, i.e.  
```
make -j8 release SDL2CONFIG=/path/to/sdl2-config CC=/path/to/my/compiler
```  

### Windows

Use Cygwin64. MinGW64 doesn't work because it is missing mmap, O_NONBLOCK, and getline.

## Disk images

```osiemu``` uses its own disk image format.
For each track it contains the complete bitstream that enters the floppy ACIA,
including all the framing and prolonged stop bits for timing.
See [_doc/disk-format.txt_](doc/disk-format.txt) for details.
The _tools_ directory contains ```hfe2osi``` and ```osi2hfe``` to convert
from and to HFE flux dumps from/for real hardware.

## GUI launcher

<img src="screenshots/osiemu-launcher.png" alt="screenshot-launcher" height="256"/>  

If you are tired of fiddling with command line options, there's also a GUI launcher.
To build, use:

```
make osiemu-launcher
```

You'll need either Qt5 or Qt6 to build it.
If you want to override the default ```qmake``` that's used during the build process,
you can specify it on the command line.
For example:

```
make -j8 osiemu-launcher QMAKE=/path/to/Qt/6.7.2/gcc_64/bin/qmake6 CXX=/path/to/clang++
```

forces a build against Qt 6.7.2 and use the clang compiler.
It has been tested with Qt 5.15.x and Qt 6.5.x and up.
On Windows, contrary to the main ```osiemu``` binary that has to be built with Cygwin, the launcher binary has to be built with MinGW.
Preferably the version that is distributed with Qt itself.

## CP/M-65

The _cpm65_ directory contains several disk images of the Ohio Scientific port of CP/M-65.
Alongside you'll find .settings files for the GUI launcher, and .config files that can be used from the command line.
For more information on what CP/M65 exactly is, how to use it, and possibly newer disk images, see the [CP/M-65 website](https://github.com/davidgiven/cpm65).
If you want to try out the serial systems version, you'll need to make sure the serial tape input and output settings point to the right (virtual) device.
As an example, they now point to /dev/pts/3.

## Notes

* The polled keyboards were limitted and had only 45 keys. Not all ASCII characters can be typed.
  Especially in raw mode, it behaves kind of weird, like CAPS affecting the number keys.
  This was by design and is normal. Cooked keyboard mode (the default) overcomes some of these quirks in emulation.
  For games you might need to switch to raw mode though, as they might do their own keyboard scan for certain combinations.
* The original ROMs did not implement backspace, even though there was a RUB key on the keyboard.
  If you want backspace in BASIC, use one of the cegmon ROMs.
* Error messages in BASIC have all kind of strange characters in them. That's normal and not a bug.
* It's possible to create a configuration that did not exist, doesn't make sense, or would not even be possible with real hardware.
  Just don't do that ;) See the sample configurations for sensible setups.
* Floppy disk emulation is enabled by specifying at least one floppy drive. The type is determined by the first floppy.
  You cannot mix 5.25" and 8" disk images. It's either four times 5.25" or four times 8".
* To emulate a serial-only system like the C3, you can disable video completely (--disable-video) and use the tape I/O ACIA as serial input and output.
  You can specify a real serial port (e.g. /dev/ttyUSB0), a pair of named pipes (mkfifo), or one end of two connected pseudo-terminals.
  
  Example:
  ```
  $ socat -d -d pty,rawer,echo=0 pty,rawer,echo=0
  2024/09/06 01:02:38 socat[936204] N PTY is /dev/pts/9
  2024/09/06 01:02:38 socat[936204] N PTY is /dev/pts/10
  2024/09/06 01:02:38 socat[936204] N starting data transfer loop with FDs [5,5] and [7,7]
  ```
  In another window:
  ```
  $ minicom -D /dev/pts/9 -b 19200
  ```
  And in yet another window:
  ```
  $ ./osiemu --disable-video \
             --kernel kernel/syn-c3-serial-hdm.rom \
             --tape-location fc00 \
             --tape-baseclock 19200 \
             --tape-input /dev/pts/10 \
             --tape-output /dev/pts/10 \
             --floppy0 some-floppy.os8
  ```
  
## Future additions?

* Binary release
* CP/M-65 sample disk images
* Sound: 1-bit ACIA RTS DAC (which model? where is the software?)
* Sound: SN76489AN and/or AY-3-8910 daughterboard
* Harddisk: Model 590/592/594/596/598 Winchester, Shugart, and Okidata, CD-74 74MB, CD-36 36MB, CD-28 28MB, CD-23 23MB, or CD-7 7MB hard drives.
* Serial: Implement S1883 UART. Is it worth it? C3 serial ROM/BASIC uses it as the alternate tape interface.
