The OSI600 Superboard II also has an optional 8-bit DAC output, similar to
the 542B/C. But instead of writing the values to $df01, the values are to
be written to $df00 that's also the row select register. Hence it has a
DAC Disable bit to avoid unwanted noise during keyboard reads.

The implementation of the bit is at 5B4 (OSI 600 schematic), the actual
bit comes from U72, located at 2C1 (OSI 600 schematic).

U72 is wired confusingly, like:

databus     LS174 inputs    function
D0      --> 3D              /32                 (32x32 mode (?))
D1      --> 2D              COLOR EN
D2      --> 1D              BK0
D3      --> 5D              BK1
D4      --> 6D              DAC DISABLE
D5      --> 4D              N.C.

Documentation is scarce.

Location of this register seems to be $d800 (ref. Third Book Of OSI, page 89)

    lda #$10        ; turn DAC on, output of LS74 is inverted(!)
    sta $d800
    ...
    lda #$00        ; turn DAC off
    sta $d800

I suppose bit 1 (D1) controls the 630 color enable.

BK0 and BK1 seem to be for bank switching. Need to investigate the schematics
further.

/32 probably switches between 32x32 and 64x32. Need to investigate if the 630
has that as an input.
