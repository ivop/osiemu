542B 8-bit DAC reverse engineered.

Assume 1N914 has resistance close to zero

Simple 2^x resistor ladder.

Values

bit 0   68K
bit 1   33K
bit 2   16K
bit 3   8.2K
bit 4   3.9K
bit 5   2K
bit 6   1K
bit 7   510R

Value is written to $df01. DAC is always active.

Ladder forms voltage divider with resistor or 510R

Signal passes through 33u capacitor, removes DC offset

In sound.c, generate 256 byte lookup table.

Note that the resistors are not exactly twice the value of the next one,
hence the bit[0..7] --> volume mapping is not linear and not even continuous!
This especially noticable around the transition of 0x7f to 0x80.
