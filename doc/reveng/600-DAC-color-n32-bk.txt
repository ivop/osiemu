The OSI600 Superboard II also has an optional 8-bit DAC output, similar to
the 542B/C. But instead of writing the values to $df01, the values are to
be written to $df00 that's also the row select register. Hence it has a
DAC Disable bit to avoid unwanted noise during keyboard reads.

The implementation of the bit is at 5B4 (OSI 600 schematic), the actual
bit comes from U72, located at 2C1 (OSI 600 schematic).

U72 is wired confusingly, like:

databus     LS174 inputs    function
D0      --> 3D              /32
D1      --> 2D              COLOR EN
D2      --> 1D              BK0
D3      --> 5D              BK1
D4      --> 6D              /DAC DISABLE
D5      --> 4D              N.C.

Documentation is scarce.

Location of this register is $d800 (ref. Third Book Of OSI, page 89)

    lda #$10        ; turn DAC on, output of LS74 is inverted(!)
    sta $d800
    ...
    lda #$00        ; turn DAC off
    sta $d800

The actual DAC has the same resistor values as the 542B/C DAC, hence the
output is identical.

Bit 1 (D1) controls the 630 color enable.

Setting the /32 bit to 1 switches from 32x32 to 64x16. Both take 1kB of screen
memory located at $d000-$d3ff. Color RAM is located at $d400-$d7ff.


BK0 and BK1 are used for bank switching. Found one use on github. Cegmon
Monitor Select uses an 8kB ROM in the monitor ROM socket and uses BK0 and BK1
to select which 2kB bank is visible.
